Amelia PM. Project Management app with Asp.net core WebApi and Angular2.

This project is an experiment with a lot excercises at the same time, to build architectures, patterns and practices around a .net core app using angular2. 

The first approach uses the same WebApp for Api and NG2 App, It is desirable that this architecture becomes more complex during time. That way, other JS Mvc Frameworks like ReactJS & EmberJS will be the next targets to use like a presentation approach.
