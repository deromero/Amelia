Amelia PM. Project Management app with Asp.net core WebApi and Angular2.

This project is an excercise and experiment at the same time, to build architectures, patterns and practices around a .net core app using angular2. 

The first aproach uses the same WebApp for Api and NG2 App, It is desirable that this architecture becomes more complex during time. Thay way, other JS Mvc Frameworks like ReactJS & EmberJS will be the next targets to use like a presentation Approach.
